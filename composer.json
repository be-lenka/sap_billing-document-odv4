You can use this service to do the following:   - Create billing documents with reference to billable SD documents in your system   - Read most billing document fields at header and item level   - Update specific billing document fields, including custom fields added through extensibility   - Post billing documents to financial accounting to create the corresponding journal entriesÂ ",
